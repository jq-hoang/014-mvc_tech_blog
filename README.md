## User Story

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Technologies:

This application follows folder structure outlined by the Model-View-Controller paradigm. 
[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) were utilized to connect to a MySQL database for the models.
[Express-Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) was chosen for the View Engine.
And finally, Express.js API was used for the Controllers.
